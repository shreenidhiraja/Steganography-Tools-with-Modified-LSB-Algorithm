# Steganography-Tools-with-Modified-LSB-Algorithm

In our project, we implement a new framework of image steganography. The sender
selects a cover file (image, text, audio or video) with secret text and hides it into the
cover file by using a different efficient algorithm and generating a stego file of the same
format as our cover file (image, text, audio or video). Then the stego file is sent to the
destination with the help of private or public communication networks. On the other side
i.e. receiver, the receiver downloads the stego file and by using the appropriate decoding
algorithm retrieves the secret text that is hidden in the stego file. The type of
steganography hence can be chosen by the user here based on the level of confidentiality
of the data to be sent. Hence, we aim to also provide versatility.

Objective:
To create a model that performs Text, Image, Audio and Video Steganography to increase the accuracy and security of data transfer.

Workflow:
Steganography hides the very existence of a message so that if successful it generally
attracts no suspicion at all. Using steganography, information can be hidden in carriers
such as images, audio files, text files, videos and data transmissions. In our project, we
implement a new framework of image steganography. The sender selects a cover file
(image, text, audio or video) with secret text and hides it into the cover file by using a
different efficient algorithm and generating a stego file of the same format as our cover
file (image, text, audio or video). Then the stego file is sent to the destination with the
help of private or public communication networks. On the other side i.e. receiver, the receiver
downloads the stego file and by using the appropriate decoding algorithm
retrieves the secret text that is hidden in the stego file.

This project hides the message within the image, text file, audio file and video file. There are two
main users, the sender and the receiver. There are two main functions, encoding and decoding. In
this project, the sender selects a cover file (image, text, audio or video) with secret text and hides
it into the cover file by using a different efficient algorithm and generates a stego file of the same
format as our cover file (image, text, audio or video). Then the stego file is sent to the destination
with the help of private or public communication networks. On the other side i.e. receiver, the
receiver downloads the stego file and by using the appropriate decoding algorithm retrieves the
secret text that is hidden in the stego file.
